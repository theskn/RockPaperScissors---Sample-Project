# How you play
## The player is presented with a choise at the beginning, which is done by entering the first letter of the players choice (R, P or S)

## If the input is invalid the game resets and a **subtle** message is given to the player.

## Once the player makes their coice, the computer randomly makes its choice and the winner is determined.

## In case if a draw, the game is restarted.
